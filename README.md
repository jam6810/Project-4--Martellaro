# Project-4--Martellaro

For this project, I plan on having three different applications within the site that are artistic in nature. Each page will be unique, but all follow a similar theme of color and activity.
The first page is going to be a simple sketchpad, with the user beginning with a blank white canvas in front of them. The program will feature different styles of brushes and colors available at the user’s disposal, along with different features such as a paint bucket. The page will also have the ability to save the drawing.
The second page will allow the user to pick a song from a list, and the background of the page changes dynamically depending on the activity of the song. The greater the song’s volume or bass, the more the page’s shapes and colors change. This page will also allow the user to skip to different points in the song.
The third page will feature a basic snake-style game, with the user controlling a “snake” and using the arrow keys to control it, and eating various objects in order to grow bigger. The game will feature user input and a high score mechanism.

For these projects, I am planning on learning Paper.js and Pixi. For the first two pages, Paper.js will be sufficient in being able to create the pages efficiently and effectively. For the third page, Pixi will be helpful, as Pixi seems the most effective at creating games with Javascript.
