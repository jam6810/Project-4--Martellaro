            <p>Obviously, I changed what javascript programs I made between the proposal and the due date. I realized that the three proposed projects didn't really fit well together, so I chose 3 projects that all had to do with music as their central theme. For this project, I extended my knowledge of javascript for all three of the pages on the site. For most of the piano and visualizer pages, I followed online tutorials. For the tuner page, I used some of what I learned from both of those pages to make a simple application.</p>

            <p>I realize that I didn't change much code, but when I tried earlier with other sources everything just broke. If I had used my time more wisely, I probably could have changed things more and turned in a better project. I tried my best.</p>
